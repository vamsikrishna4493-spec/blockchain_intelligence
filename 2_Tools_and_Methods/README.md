## 🧰 Tools and Methods  

This section outlines the key blockchain investigation tools and analytical techniques I use to support crypto compliance, on-chain forensics, and risk investigations.

### 🧩 Tools  

- **Chainalysis KYT** — Used for continuous transaction monitoring, automated alert management, and real-time wallet risk scoring.  
- **Chainalysis Reactor** — Enables deep on-chain tracing, flow visualization, and mapping of wallet networks and entity relationships.  
- **TRM Labs** — Provides multi-chain intelligence, address clustering, and typology detection for advanced risk analysis.  
- **Etherscan & Breadcrumbs** — Facilitate manual transaction reconstruction, smart contract review, and wallet relationship graphing.  
- **OSINT Techniques** — Combine open-source methods such as WHOIS lookups, domain analysis, and social media correlation to link on-chain data with real-world entities.  
- **Maltego / IntelX (Optional)** — Assist in correlating wallet data with darknet activity, breach datasets, or leaked information to establish off-chain attribution.

### ⚙️ Methods  

- **Transaction Flow Reconstruction** — Rebuilds the movement of funds step-by-step to identify key hops, layering stages, and laundering attempts.  
- **Counterparty Risk Profiling** — Assesses exposure to sanctioned entities, unlicensed exchanges, or mixers through risk-based analysis.  
- **Cross-Chain Tracing** — Tracks assets moved via bridges or cross-chain swaps to uncover attempts at obfuscating origin or ownership.  
- **Temporal Analysis** — Evaluates transaction frequency and timing patterns to detect automation, wash trading, or coordinated transfers.  
- **Pattern Recognition** — Identifies behavioral signatures such as repetitive mixer deposits, burst withdrawals, or exploit-linked fund movements.  
- **Red Flag Mapping** — Aligns analytical findings with **FATF**, **AUSTRAC**, and **FinCEN** red flag indicators to standardize escalation and reporting decisions.

By combining these tools and methods, I build end-to-end visibility into blockchain activity—connecting wallet behavior, entity exposure, and regulatory risk into a single coherent investigation framework.  
 
- **Attribution & Reporting** — Collating Etherscan, KYT, and OSINT evidence for **Suspicious Matter Reports (SMRs)** or law enforcement referrals.
