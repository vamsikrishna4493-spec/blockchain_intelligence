## 🧰 Tools and Methods

This section highlights the primary blockchain investigation tools and analytical methods I apply across crypto compliance and forensic investigations.

### 🧩 Tools

- **Chainalysis KYT** — Transaction monitoring, automated alert ingestion, and real-time risk scoring of wallets and counterparties.  
- **Chainalysis Reactor** — Deep-dive wallet tracing, flow visualization, and entity linkage mapping for investigative escalation.  
- **TRM Labs** — Cross-chain exposure analytics, entity enrichment, and address clustering to detect laundering typologies.  
- **Etherscan / Breadcrumbs** — Manual transaction reconstruction, smart contract decoding, and inter-wallet relationship graphing.  
- **OSINT Techniques** — WHOIS lookups, social media correlation, domain analysis, and blockchain explorer validation for external attribution.  
- **Maltego / IntelX** *(optional)* — Correlation of wallet addresses with darknet, breach, or leaked data repositories to establish off-chain connections.

### ⚙️ Methods

- **Transaction Flow Reconstruction** — Step-by-step tracing of illicit funds through on-chain hops to detect layering or obfuscation stages.  
- **Counterparty Risk Profiling** — Evaluating exposure to high-risk entities (mixers, unlicensed exchanges, sanctioned wallets).  
- **Cross-Chain Tracing** — Identifying bridge transfers and chain-hopping typologies used for fund laundering or obfuscation.  
- **Temporal Analysis** — Studying transaction timing and clustering to spot automation, bot activity, or laundering cycles.  
- **Pattern Recognition** — Detecting behavioral indicators (e.g., repeated 100 ETH mixer deposits, burst transfers post-exploit).  
- **Red Flag Mapping** — Aligning observations to **FATF**, **AUSTRAC**, and **FinCEN** typologies for standardized compliance escalation.  
- **Attribution & Reporting** — Collating Etherscan, KYT, and OSINT evidence for **Suspicious Matter Reports (SMRs)** or law enforcement referrals.
