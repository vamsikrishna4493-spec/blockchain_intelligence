# Tools and Methods

This section highlights the primary blockchain investigation tools and analytical methods I use in crypto compliance work.

## üß© Tools
- **Chainalysis KYT:** For transaction monitoring, alert reviews, and risk scoring.
- **Chainalysis Reactor:** For deep-dive wallet tracing and network visualization.
- **TRM Labs:** For entity tagging, exposure analysis, and cross-chain tracking.
- **OSINT Techniques:** Used to enrich address data with external intelligence (social media, darknet forums, blockchain explorers).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods
- Transaction flow reconstruction to detect layering or obfuscation patterns.
- Risk profiling using counterparty risk, transaction volume, and temporal analysis.
- Cross-chain tracing to identify bridging or mixer activity.
- Red-flag identification aligned with FATF and AUSTRAC crypto typologies.
