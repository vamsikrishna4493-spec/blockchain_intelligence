# 🧩 Crypto Compliance & Blockchain Investigations Portfolio

**Author:** Vamsi Krishna  
**Role:** Independent Blockchain Investigator | Crypto Compliance & FIU Analyst  
**Experience:** 2+ Years in Crypto Transaction Monitoring, Risk Analysis, and AML Investigations

## 👋 Introduction

Hi, I’m **Vamsi Krishna**, a blockchain investigator specializing in **crypto compliance, FIU operations, and on-chain investigations**.  
For the past two years, I’ve worked independently on **transaction monitoring and flow investigations**, reconstructing suspicious cases and tracing high-risk wallet activity using ** Breadcrumbs, and OSINT techniques, Chainalysis KYT, Reactor,**.

My work focuses on uncovering **illicit fund flows**, understanding **behavioral patterns**, and improving **red flag indicators** that help Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) detect and prevent crypto-related financial crime.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This repository showcases my **crypto compliance and investigation capabilities** — aligning with the responsibilities of an **FIU Transaction Monitoring Analyst** at **MoonPay**.

It demonstrates:
- End-to-end investigation processes  
- Analytical reasoning used to interpret blockchain transactions  
- Familiarity with **AML/CFT frameworks**, **VASP investigations**, and **SAR/SMR reporting workflows**  
- Technical curiosity and documentation discipline expected from a compliance analyst in a regulated crypto environment

## 🔍 Featured Case Studies

### 1. Investment Scam Investigation (Ethereum)
A detailed analysis of how funds flowed from victims to a scammer network via multiple wallets and DEX swaps.  
- **Objective:** Identify source of funds and exit routes.  
- **Tools:** Chainalysis Reactor, Etherscan, Breadcrumbs.  
- **Outcome:** Mapped 4 intermediary wallets linked to centralized exchanges.  
- **Compliance Insight:** Layering via ERC-20 swaps and small-amount dispersal were key laundering patterns.  

### 2. Bridge & Mixer Tracing Case (Cross-chain Flow)
A study on funds moving from **Ethereum → Tron → Binance Smart Chain** using a public bridge and Tornado Cash.  
- **Objective:** Detect pattern of obfuscation and identify service providers.  
- **Tools:** Chainalysis Reactor, Arkham Intelligence, TRM Public Risk Data.  
- **Outcome:** Cross-chain swap behavior matched known “layering” red flags; SMR draft prepared.

## 🧮 Data Analysis Examples

Within `3_Data_Analysis/`, you’ll find:
- A **simple Jupyter notebook** simulating transaction flow logic for risk scoring  
- Visual examples of **ETH transfer graphs** showing fund dispersion patterns  
- A **risk categorization model** (manual logic) that classifies alerts into *Scam / Bridge / Mixer / Exchange Funnel*  

This shows my ability to **blend investigation logic with data analytics** — a valuable combination for FIU work.

## 🧩 Compliance & FIU Workflows

Inside `4_Compliance_Procedures/`:
- **FIU Workflow:** Alert intake → Case creation → Transaction enrichment → Escalation → SMR filing  
- **Red-Flag Indicator Library:** Investment scams, Pig butchering, P2P layering, Bridge & mixer typologies  
- **SMR Template (AUSTRAC Style):** How a concise, risk-based report is structured — covering entity details, transaction summary, and rationale.  

---

## 🧠 Investigative Philosophy

My investigative approach follows three core principles:

1. **Behavioral Reconstruction** — studying previously solved cases to identify typology patterns and behavioral markers.  
2. **Evidence Integrity** — ensuring all data is verifiable and timestamped from chain explorers.  
3. **Compliance-First Mindset** — aligning all analyses with AML/CFT standards and regulatory expectations.  

I believe effective FIU work is both *technical and intuitive* — it requires data precision, investigative storytelling, and ethical responsibility.

## 🚀 Future Learning Goals

- Expand knowledge of **DeFi typologies** and **NFT-related wash trading**  
- Advance into **smart contract forensics** for deeper transaction analysis  
- Contribute to open-source crypto compliance datasets and typology guides
