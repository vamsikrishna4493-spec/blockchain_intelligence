# 🧾 Compliance Procedures and Reporting Standards  

This section highlights my approach to compliance operations and the reporting processes that guide crypto-related investigations.  
It reflects how I apply international AML/CFT frameworks to ensure accuracy, defensibility, and regulatory alignment throughout each case.

## 🔍 Key Compliance Functions  

- **Transaction Monitoring:**  
  Review and triage KYT alerts, investigate abnormal activity, and escalate cases following established FIU procedures.  

- **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):**  
  Conduct deeper reviews of wallets, entities, or counterparties showing high-risk behavior, with a focus on source of funds and exposure analysis.  

- **Case Documentation:**  
  Maintain detailed investigation logs — including transaction evidence, analytical notes, risk classification, and rationale for compliance actions.  

- **SAR/SMR Preparation:**  
  Draft clear, structured Suspicious Matter Reports (SMRs) in line with **AUSTRAC** and **FATF** reporting standards, ensuring findings are concise, evidence-backed, and regulator-ready.

## 🧩 Frameworks & Guidelines  

These investigations are guided by key global compliance frameworks:  

- **FATF Recommendation 15 & 16** – Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) & wire transfer transparency.  
- **AUSTRAC** and **EU AMLD5** – Regulatory obligations for digital asset monitoring and reporting.  
- **KYC, KYT, and Travel Rule** – Procedures ensuring transactional traceability and customer verification.  
- **Internal Risk Scoring Models** – Combining transactional, behavioral, and counterparty indicators to assign precise risk levels.

## 🚀 Outcome  

Applying these frameworks ensures that every investigation is:  

✅ **Defensible** – grounded in verifiable on-chain data  
✅ **Consistent** – aligned with standardized FIU procedures  
✅ **Auditable** – documented for regulatory and internal review  

Together, these practices strengthen compliance oversight and help build a more secure, transparent, and trustworthy crypto ecosystem.
