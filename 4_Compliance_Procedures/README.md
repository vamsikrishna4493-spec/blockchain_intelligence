# Compliance Procedures and Reporting Standards

This section summarizes my understanding of compliance frameworks and reporting workflows within the crypto investigation lifecycle.

## ðŸ§¾ Key Compliance Functions
- **Transaction Monitoring:** Reviewing KYT alerts and performing case escalation as per FIU protocol.
- **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):** Conducting in-depth investigations into high-risk wallets or counterparties.
- **Case Documentation:** Preparing case summaries with transaction evidence, risk rating, and compliance rationale.
- **SAR/SMR Drafting:** Structuring Suspicious Matter Reports aligned with AUSTRAC and FATF guidelines.

## ðŸ§© Frameworks & Guidelines
- FATF Recommendation 15 (Virtual Asset Providers)
- AUSTRAC & EU AMLD5 crypto obligations
- KYC, KYT, and Travel Rule procedures
- Internal risk scoring models (transactional, behavioral, and counterparty-based)

## ðŸš€ Outcome
By adhering to global AML/CFT standards, these procedures ensure that investigations are defensible, consistent, and auditable â€” supporting MoonPayâ€™s mission to build a secure and compliant crypto ecosystem.
