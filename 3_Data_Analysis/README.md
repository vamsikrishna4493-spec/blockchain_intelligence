# Data Analysis in Crypto Investigations

This section showcases how I apply analytical methods to uncover suspicious blockchain activity and enhance transaction monitoring outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Analytical Focus
- **Transaction Pattern Analysis:** Identify abnormal flow patterns, velocity spikes, or cyclical fund movements.
- **Counterparty Risk Assessment:** Evaluate wallet interactions based on historical exposure to illicit entities.
- **Bridge & Mixer Tracing:** Detect cross-chain activity and obfuscation attempts through on-chain heuristics.
- **Clustering & Entity Mapping:** Use Chainalysis Reactor and KYT data to group related addresses and expose hidden networks.

## ðŸ§  Technical Skills
- MS Excel & Python (for transaction flow reconstruction and outlier detection).
- Use of Chainalysis APIs for address lookups and visualization export.
- Graph interpretation and anomaly detection through link density, node frequency, and transaction weight.
- Data correlation between on-chain and off-chain identifiers (social media, domain names, exchange accounts).

## ðŸ“ˆ Compliance Value
These analyses help identify money-laundering typologies and provide evidence for SAR/SMR filings. My approach combines quantitative insight with investigative intuition to improve case accuracy.
